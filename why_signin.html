Why sign in?
</P>
</h2>

<p>There are several important reasons why you should sign in.  We
list a few here.</p>

<p><h3>Never annotate the same snippet twice</h3></p>

<p>You will never be asked to annotate exactly the same chunk of text twice. 
We will record all your annotations and provide you with a different snippet every time. 


<p><h3>Receive credit for the annotations that you provide</h3></p>

<p>You put a lot of work annotating all those snippets!
You deserve the credit for all of your hard work.</p>

<p><h3>Keep track of your annotations</h3></p>

<p>Either if you annotate the corpus we host or if you are using BioNotate to annotate your own corpora, you will be able to select only those annotations that you provided. Retrieving annotations by username is straighforward since the username is stored as part of the annotated snippet.
